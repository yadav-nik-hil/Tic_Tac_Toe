Implementation of the Tic Tac Toe Game (3X3)

The code consists of a Brute Force handling of all the possible senarios to ensure a possible win or a tie in worst case.
The code is implemented in two major sections, one being if player starts first and other being computer starts first.
Both the parts have their own strategies to ensure a worst case tie of game or a possible win of the computer.

There are a lot of portions which are similar due to the symmetric nature of the game and board(3X3).
